# Avenger AntGame

## In Brief

This project is an implementation of what can be called an "Ant Search". 
Generic ants are independently generated. They follow some basic rules, are attracted to food and leave pheromones or markers behind them depending in which state they are. It enables them to guide other in order to developp a common intelligence based on each individual experience. 

It can be implemented to solve TSP Problems
