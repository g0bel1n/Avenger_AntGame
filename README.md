# Avenger AntGame

## Briefly

This project is an implementation of what can be called an "Ant Search". Generic ants are independently generated. They
follow some basic rules, are attracted to food and leave pheromones or markers behind them depending of in which state
they are. It enables them to guide other in order to develop a common intelligence based on each individual experience.

It can be implemented to solve TSP Problems

Below, in a very simple configuration, we can see that the ants are following markers to find their direction.
